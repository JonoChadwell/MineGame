# A Motherload inspired 2d mining game

The core gameplay is navigating down and gathering useful materials to upgrade your systems.

Going further down should be accompanied by greater difficulty / risk and greater reward.

Game is playable at https://jonochadwell.github.io/MineGame/

## Short term goals

DONE - A 2d world in which a miner can move around
DONE - Dynamic loading / unloading of world blocks
DONE - Ability to destroy blocks
Better movement mechanics
Home base
Less derpy pod graphics

## Long term ideas

Destroyed pods can be recovered for a portion of resources back
Ability to combine gathered materials in temporary storage to make better resources
Separate upgrade trees for base and for pods


## Open design questions

What is the gameplay penalty for having a mining pod destroyed?
What movement mechanics feel good?
